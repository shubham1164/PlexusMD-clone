# PlexusMDTask

I have tried to clone the app UI of [PlexusMD](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexusmd.app&hl=en) app 

### Original Playstore App UI Screenshots:
```
./SampleTaskScreens
```

### React-Native version of App UI Screenhots (created by me): 
```
./SampleAppScreenshots
```

### Run the App 
```js
npm install
npm start
```
### Sample App Screenshots 
* [Screen1](https://github.com/shubham1164/PlexusMDTask/blob/master/SampleAppScreenshots/Screen1.png)
* [Screen2](https://github.com/shubham1164/PlexusMDTask/blob/master/SampleAppScreenshots/Screen2.png)
